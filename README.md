# VerdiCarbon

## üå± Project Overview

**VerdiCarbon** is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates the management and exchange of carbon credits using blockchain technology. Built on the **Stellar** network and written in **Rust**, the platform enables users to securely **mint, transfer, buy, sell, and burn** carbon credits through a digital wallet system. The platform ensures that all transactions are traceable, wallets are secure, and operations are only executed when explicitly authorized by the user.

With a focus on environmental impact and technological integrity, VerdiCarbon promotes transparency, user empowerment, and meaningful participation in the global carbon offset market.

## üåç Vision Statement

At **VerdiCarbon**, we believe that combating climate change requires open and accessible tools. Our mission is to **democratize carbon offsetting** by integrating blockchain‚Äôs transparency and decentralization into a user-friendly platform. We want to empower individuals, businesses, and organizations to participate in **climate-positive actions** by making carbon credit trading:

- Easy to use,
- Secure and auditable,
- Environmentally impactful,
- Economically scalable.

Through our platform, users can not only track and manage their carbon credits but also become part of a larger ecosystem that values accountability and environmental stewardship.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Development Plan

### 1. Smart Contract Design (Rust + Stellar)

- Define a `Wallet` structure with:
  - `balance`: native token amount
  - `carbon_credit`: current carbon credit holdings
  - `history`: transaction logs
  - `isLocked`: flag indicating if the wallet is locked

- Core Smart Contract Functions:
  - `mint(amount)`: Create new carbon credits
  - `burn(amount)`: Destroy credits to offset carbon
  - `transfer(to, amount)`: Send credits to another wallet
  - `buyCarbonCredit(amount)`: Purchase credits using balance
  - `sellCarbonCredit(amount)`: Convert credits to balance
  - `lockWallet() / unlockWallet(password)`: Prevent unauthorized operations

### 2. Error Handling & Logging

- Implement error safety using `Result<T, E>` types in Rust.
- Maintain a transaction history log by appending human-readable records to the `history` vector.

### 3. Core Business Rules

- All wallet operations require the wallet to be **unlocked**.
- Enforce checks for:
  - Sufficient balance during purchase
  - Sufficient credits during sale/transfer

### 4. Frontend Interface (React + TypeScript)

- Modular tabbed interface for:
  - **Buy**
  - **Sell**
  - **Burn**
- Dynamic feedback for operations (success, error)
- Disable all actions if the wallet is locked
- Show real-time transaction history

### 5. Stellar Blockchain Integration

- Use Anchor framework to compile and deploy Rust smart contracts to the **Stellar testnet**
- Integrate wallet interactions via Stellar‚Äôs SDK into the frontend
- Optionally include federated identity and on-chain account abstraction

### 6. Deployment

- Smart contracts deployed to **Stellar testnet**
- Web frontend hosted via **Vercel** or **Netlify**
